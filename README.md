# Udacity-FEND-Resume-Dragonborn
Second Project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree - Resume of the Dragonborn from TES V: Skyrim

With the help of some basic starter code outlined by Udacity, 
my goal was to create and personalize a resume based on a fictional character.
I used the protagonist from TES V: Skyrim, because the player ends up
with one hell of a CV by the end of the game.

I used Google Maps API and their references for custom projection
to figure out how to display the game's fictional map and places.
I also made use of the d3 library and references to create skill charts.

Last but not least, this was an invaluable resource in creating a
mist effect for the introduction page: http://jsfiddle.net/jonnyc/Ujz4P/5/
I adopted the code after making an effort to understand it and made a few tweaks.

Hopefully the overall end result is interesting.

Thank you for taking a looking at my project!
