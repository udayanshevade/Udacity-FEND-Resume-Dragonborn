# Udacity-FEND-Resume-Dragonborn
Second Project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree - Resume of the Dragonborn from TES V: Skyrim

With the help of basic starter code provided by Udacity,
I cobbled an interactive resume for a fictional character, 
the Dragonborn from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,
because the player ends up with a heck of a CV by the end of the game!

The project makes use of:

- the Google Maps API, personalized to a custom projection map for fictional locations
- the d3.js library, to create skill charts
- a JS plugin Slick Slider to provide a swipe-able slideshow
- custom navigation and modals
- a custom grid with Flexbox and custom CSS
- canvas animation to create a mist effect

I referenced this resource for the mist effect: http://jsfiddle.net/jonnyc/Ujz4P/5/
I adopted the code and made some tweaks after making an effort to understand it.
My next canvas project uses canvas more intensively.

Thanks for taking a look at my project!
